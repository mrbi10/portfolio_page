🌐 Abinanthan’s Portfolio

A simple, clean personal site built to showcase my work, skills, and projects. Everything is written from scratch without templates, with a focus on clarity and smooth UI.

🚀 What this site is

Responsive design that works on laptop and mobile

Clean CSS styling

Dedicated sections for profile, projects, and contact

🛠 Tech Stack
